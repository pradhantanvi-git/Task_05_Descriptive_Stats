# 📌 Research Task 5 – Descriptive Statistics & LLM Validation

## 📂 Project Overview

This project analyzes IPL 2022 cricket match data using Python to answer five research-oriented questions. It also evaluates responses generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and validates their accuracy using Python code and descriptive statistics.

## 🔎 Notes

- The `ChatPT_prompt` file shows the instructions given to the LLM for generating its answers.
- The `ChatGPT_LLM_analysis` file contains the LLM's response for comparison with Python-based results.
- The `script_validation` file cross-verifies the LLM answers using descriptive statistics from the dataset.
